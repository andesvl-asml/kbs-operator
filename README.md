# kbs-operator

The `kbs-operator` manages the lifecycle of `kbs` along with it's configuration when deployed
in a Kubernetes cluster


## Description

The operator manages a Kubernetes custom resource named: `KbsConfig`. Following are the key fields of the
`KbsConfig` custom resource definition
```
type KbsConfigSpec struct {

	// KbsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS configuration
	KbsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

	// KbsAsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS AS configuration
	KbsAsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsAsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

	// KbsRvpsConfigMapName is the name of the configmap that contains the KBS RVPS configuration
	KbsRvpsConfigMapName string `json:"kbsRvpsConfigMapName,omitempty"`

	// KbsAuthSecretName is the name of the secret that contains the KBS auth secret
	KbsAuthSecretName string `json:"kbsAuthSecretName,omitempty"`

	// KbsServiceType is the type of service to create for KBS
	KbsServiceType corev1.ServiceType `json:"kbsServiceType,omitempty"`

	// KbsDeploymentType is the type of KBS deployment
	// It can assume one of the following values:
	//    AllInOneDeployment: all the KBS components will be deployed in the same container
	//    MicroservicesDeployment: all the KBS components will be deployed in separate containers (part of the same Kubernetes pod)
	KbsDeploymentType DeploymentType `json:"kbsDeploymentType,omitempty"`
}
```

Note: the default deployment type is ```MicroservicesDeployment```.
The examples below apply to this mode.

An example configmap for the KBS configuration looks like this:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kbs-config-grpc
  namespace: kbs-operator-system
data:
  kbs-config.json: |
    {
        "insecure_http" : true,
        "sockets": ["0.0.0.0:8080"],
        "auth_public_key": "/etc/auth-secret/kbs.pem",
        "attestation_token_config": {
          "attestation_token_type": "CoCo"
        },
        "grpc_config" : {
          "as_addr": "http://127.0.0.1:50004"
        }
    }
```

An example configmap for AS config looks like this:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: as-config-grpc
  namespace: kbs-operator-system
data:
  as-config.json: |
    {
        "work_dir": "/opt/confidential-containers/attestation-service",
        "policy_engine": "opa",
        "rvps_store_type": "LocalFs",
        "rvps_config": {
        	"remote_addr":"http://127.0.0.1:50003"
        },
        "attestation_token_broker": "Simple",
        "attestation_token_config": {
          "duration_min": 5
        }
    }
```
Currently these configmaps needs to be created during deployment.
In subsequent releases we'll look into having these configmaps created by the operator based on user inputs.

A sample `KbsConfig` custom resource
```
apiVersion: confidentialcontainers.org/v1alpha1
kind: KbsConfig
metadata:  
  name: kbsconfig-sample
  namespace: kbs-operator-system
spec:
  kbsConfigMapName: kbs-config
  kbsAsConfigMapName: as-config  
  kbsAuthSecretName: kbs-auth-public-key
  kbsServiceType: ClusterIP
  kbsDeploymentType: MicroservicesDeployment
```


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Export env variables

Set `REGISTRY` environment variable to point to your container registry.
For example:
```sh
export REGISTRY=quay.io/user
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=${REGISTRY}/kbs-operator:latest
```

Change the tag from `latest` to any other based on your requirements.
Also ensure that the image is public.

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=${REGISTRY}/kbs-operator:latest
```

4. Create KBS auth secret

```sh
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 > kbs.key
openssl pkey -in kbs.key -pubout -out kbs.pem

kubectl create secret generic kbs-auth-public-key --from-file=kbs.pem -n kbs-operator-system
```

5. Create the KBS and AS configmaps

``` sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/microservices/kbs-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/samples/microservices/as-config.yaml
```

6. Create Custom Resource:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/microservices/kbsconfig_sample.yaml
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
Contributions are most welcome. Please take a look at the [guide](https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
